                                        The reason <span class="box__first-word">Why</span> I am so into web developement is because since day one, it only became more and more interesting. The need to know and be able to code more only kept growing.

                                    <span class="box__first-word">How</span> i learned to code.
                                        Private skype lessons with a web developement instructor was the begining. Couple months into studying i continued on my own with numerous online courses from learing platforms. To develop a better understanding of programming languages i coded several projects, some through the courses,
                                        some are my own ideas.

                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">HTML</span> - as for the most of us HTML was the beginning of a coding journey. I got the basics from my teacher and than expanded my vocabulary while working on projects and online courses.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">CSS</span> - this was the first thing that got me very excited about coding. I enjoyed drawing for a big part of my life so CSS was a new way to create for me.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">SASS, Bootstrap, Materialize</span> - i use SASS whenever i can to write my CSS. I got used to it during my online courses and i find it very comfortable, escpeially when combined with BEM naming methodology. Bootstrap and Materialize, i have never learned these frameworks myslef, however i had to use it through my online courses so i have the basic knowledge of how it works.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">JavaScript</span> - JS is the part where i spent most of my learning time. I am very interested in DOM manipulation and the way JS allows you to interact with your website. I also spent a decent amount of time on coding some apps (budget calculator, pig game, MyCryptoApp. All found in projects section).</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">jQuery</span> - i have only coded one website using jQuery. I did it just to have an understanding of how it works. However i did not spend a lot of time learning it deeper, because i was more interested in plain JS and how all the functions work under the hood.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">React</span> - in progress...</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">PHP</span> - i spent only one week to go through some of the PHP course. I wanted to find out what it was and how it worked. I have touched some of the back end programming and found it quite interesting. I would love to learn more about PHP, however i wanted to focus all my time and effort on JavaScript</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">PhotoShop</span> - i know only the basics with photoshop. Had a one week online course about it, but did not want to go deeper due to lack of time. However i would love to learn more about this program because web design looks very interesting to me.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">Webpack</span> - once i found out about webpack i instantly bought an online course for it. I wanted to know a bit more about how it worked and how to make a custom setup. Now i do.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">Tools</span> - for my code writting i was using Atom and Brackets for a long time. But recently i switched to Visual Sutdio Code, mainly due to the easy Live Server possibility. For my browser i use Google Chrome. To edit my pictures i am using PhotoShop</li>

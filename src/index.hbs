                                        Private Skype lessons with a web developement instructor was the beginning. Couple months into studying I continued on my own with numerous online courses from learing platforms. To develop a better understanding of programming languages I coded several projects, some through the courses,
                                        some are my own ideas.

                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">HTML</span> - as for the most of us HTML was the beginning of a coding journey. I got the basics from my teacher and then expanded my vocabulary while working on projects and online courses.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">CSS</span> - this was the first thing that got me very excited about coding. I enjoyed drawing for a big part of my life so CSS was a new way to create for me.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">SASS, Bootstrap, Materialize</span> - I use SASS when I can to write my CSS. I got used to it during my online courses and I find it very comfortable, especially when combined with BEM naming methodology. Bootstrap and Materialize, I have never learned these frameworks myself, however I had to use it through my online courses so I have the basic knowledge of how it works.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">JavaScript</span> - JS is the part where I spent most of my learning time. I am very interested in DOM manipulation and the way JS allows you to interact with your website. I also spent a decent amount of time on coding some apps (budget calculator, pig game, MyCryptoApp. All found in projects section).</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">jQuery</span> - I have only coded one website using jQuery. I did it just to have an understanding of how it works. However I did not spend a lot of time learning it deeper, because I was more interested in plain JS and how all the functions work under the hood.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">React</span> - I went through React course (basic React, routing, redux) with my online teacher and I am currently going through some online React courses just for practice and better understanding of this framework. There is a section in my projects page to show what I am able to do with React up to this point. </li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">PHP</span> - I spent only one week to go through some of the PHP course. I wanted to find out what it was and how it worked. I have touched some of the back-end programming and found it quite interesting. I would love to learn more about PHP, however I wanted to focus all my time and effort on JavaScript</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">Photoshop</span> - I know only the basics with Photoshop. Had a one week online course about it, but did not want to go deeper due to lack of time. However I would love to learn more about this program because web design looks very interesting to me.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">Webpack</span> - once I found out about Webpack I instantly bought an online course for it. I wanted to know a bit more about how it worked and how to make a custom setup. Now I do.</li>
                                        <li class="skills__list-entry"><span class="skills__span">Tools</span> - for my code writing I was using Atom and Brackets for a long time. But recently I switched to Visual Sutdio Code, mainly due to the easy Live Server possibility. For my browser I use Google Chrome. To edit my pictures I am using Photoshop</li>
